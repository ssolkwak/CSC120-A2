What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    It was challenging to re-orient a program that already works well. I also had some struggle implementing computer objects into inventory. I became a lot more comfortable with python and the process of programming after doing this assignment as I got to revise my work over and over. I would advise to talk out a lot either with the instructor or the classmates. I think it could be a productive break from just looking at the screen and loosen up new ideas.
